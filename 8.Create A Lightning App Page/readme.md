# EduConsultPro Home Page Configuration

This document describes the creation and configuration of the EduConsultPro Home Page within the Salesforce Lightning Experience.

## Lightning App Page Creation

A Lightning app page named "EduConsultPro Home Page" was created. This page serves as the central landing page for users accessing the EduConsultPro application.

## Home Page Configuration

The EduConsultPro Home Page was configured with the following settings:

* **App Assignment:** The page was set as the default Home page for the "Sales" app.  This ensures that users accessing the Sales app land directly on the EduConsultPro Home Page.  
* **Profile Assignment:** The page was assigned to the System Administrator profile. This grants system administrators access to the customized home page.  You can extend access to other profiles as needed.

* **Flow Display:** The Combined Master Flow (described in a previous response) is embedded and displayed prominently on the EduConsultPro Home Page.  This allows users to immediately initiate either the new student admission process or the existing student appointment booking process.


## Benefits of a Customized Home Page

* **Streamlined User Experience:** Provides a focused and relevant landing page for users.
* **Improved Navigation:**  Directly presents key functionalities through the embedded Combined Master Flow.
* **Enhanced Branding:**  Allows for customization and branding to align with the institution's identity.
* **Increased Efficiency:**  Reduces clicks and navigation steps for users to access core functionalities.


By configuring the EduConsultPro Home Page as the default for the Sales app and embedding the Combined Master Flow, users are presented with a clear and efficient starting point for interacting with the EduConsultPro CRM solution.
